Description: 'R' re-implementation of the regression-based causal mediation analysis with a treatment-mediator interaction term, as originally implemented in the 'SAS' macro by Valeri and VanderWeele (2013) <doi:10.1037/a0031034> and Valeri and VanderWeele (2015) <doi:10.1097/EDE.0000000000000253>. Linear and logistic models are supported for the mediator model. Linear, logistic, loglinear, Poisson, negative binomial, Cox, and accelerated failure time (exponential and Weibull) models are supported for the outcome model.
