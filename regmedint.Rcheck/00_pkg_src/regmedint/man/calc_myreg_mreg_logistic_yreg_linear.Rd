}
\arguments{
\item{mreg}{A character vector of length 1. Mediator regression type: \code{"linear"} or \code{"logistic"}.}

\item{mreg_fit}{Model fit from \code{\link{fit_mreg}}}

\item{yreg}{A character vector of length 1. Outcome regression type: \code{"linear"}, \code{"logistic"}, \code{"loglinear"}, \code{"poisson"}, \code{"negbin"}, \code{"survCox"}, \code{"survAFT_exp"}, or \code{"survAFT_weibull"}.}

\item{yreg_fit}{Model fit from \code{\link{fit_yreg}}}

\item{avar}{A character vector of length 1. Treatment variable name.}

\item{mvar}{A character vector of length 1. Mediator variable name.}

\item{cvar}{A character vector of length > 0. Covariate names. Use \code{NULL} if there is no covariate. However, this is a highly suspicious situation. Even if \code{avar} is randomized, \code{mvar} is not. Thus, there should usually be some confounder(s) to account for the common cause structure (confounding) between \code{avar} and \code{yvar}.}

\item{interaction}{A logical vector of length 1. Default to TRUE. Whether to include a mediator-treatment interaction term in the outcome regression model.}
}
\value{
A list contraining a function for effect estimates and a function for corresponding standard errors.
}
\description{
Construct functions for the conditional effect estimates and their standard errors in the mreg logistic / yreg linear setting. Internally, this function deconstruct model objects and feed parameter estiamtes to the internal worker functions \code{calc_myreg_mreg_logistic_yreg_linear_est} and \code{calc_myreg_mreg_logistic_yreg_linear_se}.
